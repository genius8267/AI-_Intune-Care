# Demo Video Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the Intune-Care demo video.

To create the actual demo video:
1. Record a screen capture of the demo/run_demo.sh in action
2. Show the <700ms latency in real-time
3. Demonstrate Korean language input/output
4. Show the safety system triggering on crisis keywords
5. Keep it under 2 minutes for judges

The video should showcase:
- One-click demo execution
- Real-time voice processing
- Korean emotional understanding
- Safety intervention example
- Latency measurement display
